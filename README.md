# air-quality-prediction

This project is a group coursework on the data mining module designed to predict air quality (PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations of the next 48 hours) in London.

The 'Updating' folder is used to share new updates that need to be merged into the "Released" folder.

The 'Released' folder is used to share the existing final code and the remaining Todo-list.

The entire folder of 'London' can refer to the sharing google drive folder, which contains all of the processed data files. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ueRCwIpzqs520pXdmIw77c9leaLDkO4y?usp=sharing)
